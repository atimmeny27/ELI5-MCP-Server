    "A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often \"0\" and \"1\" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc.",
    "Binary Number System uses two digits, ' 0' and '1', and is the foundation for all modern computing.The word binary is derived from the word \"bi,\" which means two. But what makes it so essential, and how does it work? This article will dive deep into binary numbers, binary decimal number conversion and vice versa, 1's and 2's complements, and how they are used in computer systems.",
    "Early computer systems had mechanical switches that turned on to represent 1, and turned off to represent 0. By using switches in series, computers could represent numbers using binary code. Modern computers still use binary code in the form of digital ones and zeroes inside the CPU and RAM.",
    "The binary system is the primary language of computing systems. Inside these systems, a binary number consists of a series of eight bits. This series is known as a byte. In the binary schema, the position of each digit determines its decimal value. Thus, by understanding the position of each bit, a binary number can be converted into a decimal ..."

  "explanation": "Computers speak a special language called \"binary.\" In this language, everything is made up of just two numbers: 0 and 1. Computers use this simple language to do all their work, from storing information to playing games. It's like a secret code that the computer can understand, even though it might seem a little strange to us at first!"
