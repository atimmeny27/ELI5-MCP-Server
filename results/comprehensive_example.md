# Why cant stenographers just voice record court rooms?

Alright, let's talk about why court stenographers can't just use voice recorders instead of their special keyboards. It's a pretty interesting topic!

You see, when people are talking in a courtroom, they say a whole lot of stuff, and it's really important to write down every single word. That's where the stenographers come in. They use these cool keyboards that let them type super-fast, almost as fast as people are talking. 

The thing is, regular voice recorders can sometimes miss little details or mix up words that sound the same. But stenographers are experts at listening and typing, so they can catch every single word, even if it's said really quickly or has a tricky accent. It's like they have superhuman hearing and typing skills!

Another reason they can't just use voice recorders is that the records they make are really important. They need to be able to make copies and share them with everyone who needs them, like the judge, the lawyers, and the people who are part of the case. With a voice recording, it's harder to make copies and share them around.

Also, in some courtrooms, they're not even allowed to have cameras or digital recorders. So the stenographers are the only way to make a perfect record of what's happening. It's kind of like how you can't take pictures in certain places, but you can still write down what you see.

The stenographers are super important because they're the ones who make sure the whole court case is recorded correctly. They're like the superheroes of the courtroom, using their special keyboards to save the day! And even though we have all kinds of cool technology these days, the stenographers are still the best way to make sure we have a perfect record of everything that's said.

So, that's why the court stenographers can't just use voice recorders â€“ they're the experts at making sure we have a complete and accurate record of what happens in the courtroom. Pretty amazing, right?
