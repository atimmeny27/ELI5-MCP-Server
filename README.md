# ELI5-Tool

This tool prompts Claude to explain any topic like you are 5, concept taken from the popular subreddit. It fetches content throguh an API key for the browser DuckDuckGo, and allows Claude to use the browser to search any sources it finds relevant. This is primarily a CLI program, but you can also make the explanations into a .md file.
